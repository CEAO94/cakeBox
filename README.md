# CakeBox Java Project
This project is a native Java Application developed using NetBeans. The project simulates a real-world oven storing cakes using a stack linear collection to add, list and remove elements (cakes) in a Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) manner. 

The objective is to demonstrate how data structures can manage inventory systems efficiently, ensuring proper addition, tracking and removal of items.
